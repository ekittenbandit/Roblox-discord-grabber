# Script for Discord Linked Ropro Users

This simple script is designed to grab a list of players in your game who have linked their Discord account with Ropro.

# Usage
The list will be printed out in the console, showing the player's name and their linked Discord account. If no players have linked their Discord account, the script will print "No discords found."

# Note
This script only works with Synapse X/executors that use the Synapse X API.
